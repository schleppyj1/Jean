# NPM Contribution Assignment.
## This module allows the author's name to show up when typing in node index.js into the terminal.
### Step 1: Create an account on npmjs.com
### Step 2: Create a package.json file by typing in the terminal npm init -y.
### Step 3: Create an index.js file and use #!/usr/bin/env node and console.log to print your name.
### Step 4: Add a bin with your-name and index.js. 
### Step 5: Go to https://jsonlint.com to validate your package.json file. 
### Step 6: Run the index.js file by typing node index.js to confirm it works. If it does, it will show your name in the terminal.

## Installing EsLint:
### To install ESLint, I typed in npm install eslint --save-dev.
### It then asked me a series of questions, such as how I would like to use eslint, the types 
### of modules that my project uses and where the code runs. 
### To run eslint in the future, open up a new terminal using bash or zsh and type in 
### npm run eslint. If any problems occur, eslint will highlight them for you to fix.
